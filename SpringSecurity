User details in memory instead of reading application.properties file.
User implements UserDetailsInterface
UserDetailsService extends UserDetailsInterface
UserDetailsManager extends UserDetailsService
InMemoryUserDetailsManager, JdbcUserDetailsManager and LdapUserDetailsManager are implementations of UserDetailsManager interface.
For testing purposes we can use InMemoryUserDetailsManager where user credentials are stored in apllication memory.
For production ready applications, JdbcUserDetailsManager could be used.
